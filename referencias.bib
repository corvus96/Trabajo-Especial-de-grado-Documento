   abstract = {An accessory pulsatile organ of an open circulatory system in insects supplying the antennae with haemolymph was investigated. The rhythm of this so-called antenna–heart is generated by a myogenic automatism and can be neuronally influenced via the nervus cardioantennalis. The action potentials of the muscle fibres show typical pre-depolarization and mostly no overshoot. A specific membrane resistance (Rm ) of about 660?cm−2 was calculated for the fibres. Some electrical coupling between the muscle fibres is presumed for synchronization of any myogenically triggered heart beat which could actually be proved experimentally by cur- rent injection in the antenna–heart. However, intercalated disks or gap junctions could not be found. Nevertheless, a good coupling factor (U2 /U1 ) between all fibres was demonstrated by parallel recordings and can be well described by a conductance model according to fibre topology.},
