   abstract = {An accessory pulsatile organ of an open circulatory system in insects supplying the antennae with haemolymph was investigated. The rhythm of this so-called antenna–heart is generated by a myogenic automatism and can be neuronally influenced via the nervus cardioantennalis. The action potentials of the muscle fibres show typical pre-depolarization and mostly no overshoot. A specific membrane resistance (Rm ) of about 660?cm−2 was calculated for the fibres. Some electrical coupling between the muscle fibres is presumed for synchronization of any myogenically triggered heart beat which could actually be proved experimentally by cur- rent injection in the antenna–heart. However, intercalated disks or gap junctions could not be found. Nevertheless, a good coupling factor (U2 /U1 ) between all fibres was demonstrated by parallel recordings and can be well described by a conductance model according to fibre topology.},

@book{Szeliski2020,
   abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},
